# Concurrent Trading Engine Design

## Overview

The SideBet trading engine implements robust concurrency controls to handle high-frequency trading operations while maintaining data consistency and preventing race conditions. This document outlines the design decisions, implementation details, and best practices used.

## Key Challenges Addressed

### 1. Race Conditions in Order Matching
**Problem**: Multiple orders could attempt to match with the same order simultaneously, leading to overselling or inconsistent fills.

**Solution**: 
- Use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` to lock orders during matching
- Implement serializable transaction isolation for critical operations
- Lock all potentially matching orders before processing

### 2. Balance Validation Race Conditions
**Problem**: User balance could change between validation and execution, allowing double-spending.

**Solution**:
- Lock user accounts during order placement with `with_for_update()`
- Reserve balance immediately upon order creation
- Refund unused balance only after order completion

### 3. Position Update Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple trades could update the same position concurrently, causing data corruption.

**Solution**:
- Lock positions during updates with `with_for_update()`
- Perform position calculations within the same transaction as trades
- Use proper average price calculations for position aggregation

### 4. Order Book Consistency
**Problem**: Orders could be modified while being read, leading to inconsistent market data.

**Solution**:
- Use consistent read isolation levels
- Lock orders when calculating statistics
- Implement retry logic for transient conflicts

## Architecture Components

### 1. TradingEngine Class

The core trading engine implements several concurrency patterns:

```python
class TradingEngine:
    def __init__(self, db: Session):
        self.db = db
        self.max_retries = 3
        self.base_retry_delay = 0.1
        self.metrics = get_metrics_collector()
```

**Key Features**:
- Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Deadlock detection and recovery

### 2. Serializable Transaction Context Manager

```python
@contextmanager
def serializable_transaction(self):
    for attempt in range(self.max_retries):
        try:
            self.db.execute(text("SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE"))
            yield
            self.db.commit()
            return
        except Exception as e:
            self.db.rollback()
            # Handle serialization conflicts with retry logic
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic retry on serialization failures
- Exponential backoff with jitter to reduce thundering herd
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Row-Level Locking Strategy

The engine uses strategic row-level locking to prevent conflicts:

```python
# Lock contract to prevent status changes
contract = self.db.query(Contract).filter(
    Contract.contract_id == contract_id
).with_for_update().first()

# Lock user account to prevent balance race conditions  
user = self.db.query(User).filter(
    User.user_id == user_id
).with_for_update().first()

# Lock all matching orders
matching_orders = self.db.query(Order).filter(
    # ... matching criteria
).with_for_update().order_by(Order.price.asc()).all()
```

### 4. Database Configuration

Enhanced connection pooling and isolation settings:

```python
engine = create_engine(
    settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI,
    poolclass=QueuePool,
    pool_size=20,
    max_overflow=30,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    pool_recycle=3600,
    connect_args={
        "options": "-c default_transaction_isolation=read_committed"
    }
)
```

## Concurrency Control Mechanisms

### 1. Optimistic Locking with Retry
- Detect serialization failures and deadlocks
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter
- Maximum retry attempts to prevent infinite loops

### 2. Pessimistic Locking
- Use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` for critical resources
- Lock in consistent order to prevent deadlocks
- Minimize lock duration to improve throughput

### 3. Transaction Isolation
- Use SERIALIZABLE isolation for order placement
- READ COMMITTED for read-only operations
- Proper transaction boundaries

### 4. Resource Ordering
- Always lock resources in the same order:
  1. Contract
  2. User accounts (ordered by user_id)
  3. Orders (ordered by price, then time)
  4. Positions

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Connection Pooling
- 20 persistent connections with 30 overflow
- Connection recycling every hour
- Pre-ping validation to handle dropped connections

### 2. Batch Operations
- Lock multiple counterparty users in single query
- Aggregate position updates within transactions
- Minimize database round trips

### 3. Metrics and Monitoring
- Real-time performance tracking
- Latency percentiles (P95, P99)
- Concurrency conflict rates
- System health monitoring

## Error Handling

### 1. Serialization Conflicts
```python
if any(keyword in error_msg for keyword in ['serialization', 'deadlock']):
    if attempt < self.max_retries - 1:
        delay = self.base_retry_delay * (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 0.05)
        time.sleep(delay)
        continue
```

### 2. Deadlock Detection
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Metrics tracking for deadlock frequency
- Proper resource ordering to minimize deadlocks

### 3. Balance Validation
- Immediate balance reservation
- Proper refund mechanisms
- Validation within locked transactions

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Real-time Metrics
- Order placement latency
- Trade execution rate
- Success/failure rates
- Retry and conflict rates

### 2. Health Checks
- System status (healthy/degraded/critical)
- Performance thresholds
- Error rate monitoring

### 3. API Endpoints
- `/api/v1/system/metrics` - Comprehensive metrics
- `/api/v1/system/health` - Health status
- `/api/v1/system/performance/summary` - Dashboard data

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Concurrent Load Testing
- Multiple threads placing orders simultaneously

- Data consistency verification

### 2. Stress Testing
